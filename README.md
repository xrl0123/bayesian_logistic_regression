In 1825, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin the famous French lawyer better known as an epicure and gastronome published this now celebrated quote in his masterpiece book Physiology of Taste: “Dis-moi ce que tu manges, je te dirai ce que tu es” which translates to “Tell me what you eat and I will tell you who you are.” I haven’t read the book so it is unclear what methods he used almost 200 years ago. However, with Bayesian Logistic Regression, we could be the modern-day Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.

The coronavirus pandemic has taken many lives and it is a serious global health threat. This project aims to determine if the covid-19 infection rate is related to what people eat in a country. And whether a healthy diet could be a non-pharmaceutical intervention to prevent catching the virus.
